# ocaml-sublimetext-template
Simple template to work with small ocaml projects in sublimetext

### Usage

 Put the file ocamlbuild.sublime-build into your SublimeText User packages folder. This will give you a build system that executes the script "./my_build.sh". You can jump to the error by using the F4 key.

 The current script executes main.native after a successful build.
